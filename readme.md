Projet C 
Axel Hugo Cyprien.
main.c contains all the functions needed to run the project :
-generate_dict_abs_path
-parseLines
-main
 In order to launch the project it is just needed to run the main file. Then, in order to navigate through the different menus the only thing to do is to navigate following the menu's instructions. It is required to first add words in the tree before trying to make sentence or find word.
/!\ DISCLAIMER : Please do not add too much words to the tree beacuse you will maybe have the exit code -1073740940 (0xC0000374)
